# biblion-web

This project contains the frontend functionality for the biblion project, a simple pastebin-like file upload service.

## Local development

The project comes with a preconfigured development container configuration and requires no additional setup.
Please note that the devcontainer depends on the `biblion-network` network to exist. This is usually created by running `biblion-api` locally so it can communicate with the backend on the same network.
